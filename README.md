STABILIZATION OF A NONLINEAR UNDERACTUATED AUTONOMOUS AIRSHIP-A CONBINED AVERAGING AND BACKSTEPPING APPROACH - Notes

*The dynamic modelling involves 6 equations with only 3 inputs

*This airship can't be stabilized to a point using continous pure-state feedback law

*The stabilization problem is solved with an explicit homogeneous time-varying control law, based on an avaranging approach

*Airships are member of the family of under-actuated systems because they have fewer inputs than degrees of freedom

DYMAMIC MODEL
*has the particularity that the origin of the body fixed frame is the center of gravity, while in the cited works,

*it is located in the center of volume.

*An airship is propelled by thrust.

*Inputs: the main and tail thrusters and the tilt angle of the propellers

*The unactated dynamics implies contraints of the accelerations.

*The dynamic positioning control problem consists of finding a feedback control law that asymptotically

*stabilizes both position and orientation to fixed constant values.
